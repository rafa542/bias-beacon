We're building a google chrome plugin called "Bias Beacon".

Our Value Proposition: A tool for readers to learn about the biases of the news they are reading. This tool works in real-time and offers article-level insights.

Our Mission Statement: To help readers navigate bias in the modern media environment.

How: We use bias identification software to help readers learn about the reliability of news sources.

Goal: The goal is take in content on the media page that the user is reading, send it to a server, identify which words are above a threshold in bias, and then highlight those words. On hover, the user should see a tooltip appear that shows the bias score and a bias reason.

Specific architectural requirements:

- This must be a google chrome plugin.
- It must contain at the bare minimum content-script.js, manifest.json, and background.js
