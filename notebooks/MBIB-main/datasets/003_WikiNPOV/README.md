# 003 WikiNPOV
Authors use Wikipedia’s POV
tags to collect biased and unbiased sentences, resulting in a collection of 11,945 sentences. If a sentence is flagged with a POV tag, it indicates a violation of Wikipedia’s
neutral point of view (NPOV) policy. They collect a vast amount
of such flagged sentences and filter those where only a single statement was corrected
in the revision. Five thousand statements were sampled and annotated by crowdsourcing on whether they entail bias. Only those statements annotated as biased
were added to the NPOV Corpus as biased sentences. Finally, the NPOV Corpus
was enlarged with neutral statements.
